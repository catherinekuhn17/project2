# Breadth First Search Implementation

Included is an implementation of the breadth first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS can be used to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a graph. Starting with the start node, this algorithm explores all of this nodes neighbors before exploring those neighbor's neighbors. Therefore, a queue is used to ensure that all neighbors are explored before moving on. Additionally, explored nodes are marked as visited, to ensure they are not explored again. To recover the shortest path after traversing to the end node, once can backtrace by finding the parent of each node from the ending node to the start. Therefore, a dictionary of parent node: child node is recorded during the implimentation, so that this information may be recovered.
